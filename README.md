# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project

This repository has all the code and report for my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone project.

## Starbucks Capstone Challenge: Using Starbucks app user data to predict effective offers

### 1. Installations
This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:

- pandas
- numpy
- math
- json
- sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split module)
- sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures)
- from sklearn.tree (DecisionTreeClassifier,DecisionTreeRegressor)
- sklearn.ensemble (RandomForestClassifier)
- sklearn.metrics (mean_squared_error,classification_report)
- sklearn.linear_model (Ridge)
- time
- sklearn.model_selection (GridSearchCV)
- matplotlib

### 2. Project Motivation
This project is the Capstone project of my Data Scientist nanodegree with Udacity. As students in the nanodegree, we have the option to take part in the Starbucks Capstone Challenge.
For the challenge, Udacity provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.

In this project, I use the data to answer 2 business questions:

  - a. What are the main drivers of an effective offer on the Starbucks app?
  - b. Could the data provided, namely offer characteristics and user demographics, predict whether a user would take up an offer?

### 3. File Descriptions
This repo contains 4 files. The report of my project is called 'Starbucks Capstone Challenge - Using Starbucks app user data to predict effective offers.ipynb'. 
The data used in the project is in the files portfolio.json, profile.json and transcript.json. 

### 4. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.

Data for coding project was provided by Udacity.
